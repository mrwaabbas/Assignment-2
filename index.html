            <p> Why single women without dependents are less likely to seek shelter compared to single men and families with children. </p>

            <p> Over 90% of homeless women have experienced severe physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives.
                It’s no surprise, then, that many homeless women feel uncomfortable staying in shelters with men.</p>
                
                <p> There’s a false perception that women don’t face homelessness as frequently as men, but the 
                    reluctance of women staying in shelters reflects a broader issue. If you’re a woman facing 
                    homelessness, most available assistance falls into two categories: shelters and services 
                    for mothers with children, or being grouped together with homeless men. </p>

                    </script>
                
               <p> Unfortunately, there aren’t many shelters or services specifically designed for women without
                children. While resources and shelters for women with children have grown significantly in recent years, 
                this progress hasn’t extended to women without dependents. For a time, homeless mothers with children were 
               the fastest-growing demographic in the U.S. homeless population, prompting significant 
               resources to address this alarming trend. However, women without children have been 
               largely overlooked, leaving them vulnerable and underserved.</p>
